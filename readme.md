# tigerbeetle-wing

## Install

We use pnpm:

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Dev

Wing it:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

## Test

There's a Wing test that can be executed in the Console, but also:

```sh
pnpm run test
```

## Hacks

- Had to patch the npm package `tigerbeetle-node` so it can find the `tigerbeetle` binary. This should be fixed in the future in Wing somehow
